Revision history for DBIx-Class-Migration

0.011   04 March 2012
        - Added a bit to the FAQ regarding the extra warnings to STDOUT/ERR.
        - specify more modern version of some dependencies, since I am using the
          more modern features.

0.010   02 March 2012
        - The mysql sandbox no longer uses TCP networking.  This should make it
          possible to run parallel tests and have more than one user sharing a
          single development server.
        - Avoid infinite recursive when I can't infer the schema class (this
          fixes regression introduced in previous version).

0.009   01 March 2012
        - changed the way we look for a schema so that commands that don't need
          one (like help and version) can still run.
        - if a postgresql sandbox is already running, just use it and don't try
          (and fail) to start it again.
        - changed the mysql sandbox code so that when Test::mysqld is patched
          it will work just like postgresql does in the above change-line.

0.008   01 March 2012

        - help command now does something meaningful (felliott++)
        - test case for help command

0.007   29 February 2012
        - Catalyst::TraitFor::Model::DBIC::Schema::FromMigration now lets you
          set some connect_info args instead of deleting them.
        - silence some warnings about my unclear use of 'shift'
        - Fixed a use.t problem where I was trying to check a module that had
          optional dependencies
