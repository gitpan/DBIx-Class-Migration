Revision history for DBIx-Class-Migration

0.021  11 April 2012
        - Documentation and debug output fixes (RsrchBoy++)
        - fixed regression when using DBIC:DeploymentHandler v0.002112+
          (lxp@cpan.org++)
        - New Feature: We set  %ENV variables for key settings so that
          information is passed to install / up-downgrade scripts.

0.020  28 March 2012
        - fixed typo that caused new command added in 0.018 to fail (nour.sharabash++)
        - documentation typo fixes (logie17++)

0.019  16 March 2012
        - Fixed broken POD in the third part of the tutorial that prevented
          the page from being rendered.
        - Updated a number of dependencies to newer version to solve some
          reported problems.

0.018  15 March 2012
        - Documentation fixes (Volker++)
        - Project title change
        - ::SchemaLoader now more carefully preserves connection information
          from its target database (code cribbed from frew++)
        - new command: "dbic-migration install_version_storage", which lets you
          force install the versioning tables and metadate into a target DB.
          This could be useful if you have an existing database that you want
          to start versioning.

0.017  14 March 2012
        - POD and documentation fixes (logie17++)
        - new command: "dbic-migration diagram".  If GraphViz is installed will
          produce a png file of the current schema.  EXPERIMENTAL!

0.016  12 March 2012
        - More POD and documentation fixes  (Volker++), (logie17++)
        - changed the way I declare version requirements in my dist.ini filr
          in order address some bugs in the way version strings are interpreted
          in various versions of Perl.

0.015  08 March 2012
        - Minor typo fixes in the tutorial (Volker++)
        - FAQ entry regarding ubuntu + AppArmor and MySQL sandboxes (Volker++)

0.014   07 March 2012
        - Changed the way we depend on File::ShareDir::ProjectDistDir

0.013   05 March 2012
        - upped DBIC:DH dependency version to take advantage of required
          fixes and overall improvements
        - If using an existing mysql sandbox, that is not running, if the
          socket directory is missing, we create it.
        - Test case for above problem.

0.012   05 March 2012
        - Upped Pod::Parser dependency version to close some reported test
          failures.
        - Documentation tweaks

0.011   04 March 2012
        - Added a bit to the FAQ regarding the extra warnings to STDOUT/ERR.
        - specify more modern version of some dependencies, since I am using the
          more modern features.

0.010   02 March 2012
        - The mysql sandbox no longer uses TCP networking.  This should make it
          possible to run parallel tests and have more than one user sharing a
          single development server.
        - Avoid infinite recursive when I can't infer the schema class (this
          fixes regression introduced in previous version).

0.009   01 March 2012
        - changed the way we look for a schema so that commands that don't need
          one (like help and version) can still run.
        - if a postgresql sandbox is already running, just use it and don't try
          (and fail) to start it again.
        - changed the mysql sandbox code so that when Test::mysqld is patched
          it will work just like postgresql does in the above change-line.

0.008   01 March 2012
        - Fixed failing test when optional dependency is not installed
        - help command now does something meaningful (felliott++)
        - test case for help command

0.007   29 February 2012
        - Catalyst::TraitFor::Model::DBIC::Schema::FromMigration now lets you
          set some connect_info args instead of deleting them.
        - silence some warnings about my unclear use of 'shift'
        - Fixed a use.t problem where I was trying to check a module that had
          optional dependencies

0.006   28 February 2012
        - let you dump fixtures from an unversioned DB, but warn about it.
        - FAQ entry about this

0.005   27 February 2012
        - solved a problem when the msql socket path can exceed 104 characters
